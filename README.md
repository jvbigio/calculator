# Summary

As a self-taught developer, I enjoy building applications and finding new ways to challenge myself and build upon my current skill set. For this calculator app, users can perform basic math operations, as well as save values in memory, delete from memory, or clear all data. Although simple in design, there were various challenges I faced building this application, such as implementing the logic for continuous math operations. That said, I learned a lot building this application, including debugging via Chrome DevTools. I plan to add more complex functionality to this application in the near future.
